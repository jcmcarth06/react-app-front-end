                    <p>Decide whether you want a one-syllable puzzle (Hink Pink), a two-syllable puzzle (Hinky Pinky), or a three-syllable (Hinkety Pinkety)</p>
                    <p>The number of syllables in the title of the category indicates the number of syllables in the solution, and each word in the solution will rhyme</p>
                    <p>Each puzzle comes with a definition clue to the solution that fits within the syllable count of the category</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <p>HINKY PINKY// A filthy, small, flying animal</p>
                    <p>We know that this will be a solution comprised of two two-syllable words that rhyme with one another</p>
                    <p>(Solution: Dirty Birdy)</p>
